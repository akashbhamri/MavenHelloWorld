Thank you for the update regarding index maintenance. You mentioned that reindexing should preferably be done while the BB application is down.

I would like to clarify one point:

Does BB provide any option or configuration to block/reject user transactions (similar to a “maintenance mode”) during this period, rather than requiring a full application shutdown?

Or is completely shutting down the BB application the only supported method to ensure no transactions are sent to the database during reindexing?

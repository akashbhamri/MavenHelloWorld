For your awareness, we discussed the matter with the DB team and involved their experts. We also shared the script received from the FB team, which is used for the Bitbucket applicationâ€™s index rebuild. Sahul and Summant, who have prior experience optimizing the DB script, will be working on this task. The DB team is focusing on query optimization to avoid similar index-rebuild issues going forward. We will provide updates as progress is made.

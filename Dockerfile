Subject: Request for Active Support During Index Rebuild

Dear Team,

As discussed on the call, we request the DB team to provide active support during the index rebuild window.
If any blocking is observed, please capture the diagnostic dump and, after obtaining client approval, proceed to terminate the rebuild job to maintain system stability.

Your prompt attention and cooperation in executing this process are highly appreciated.

Best regards,

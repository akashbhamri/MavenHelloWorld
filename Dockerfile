This situation led to database locks that were not released automatically. Since the DB resource was not fully aware of how to identify and resolve lock conditions, and no proper documentation was available from their side, the issue was not addressed in a timely manner. Additionally, the rebuild index job was not terminated to release the blocking locks, which further prolonged the downtime. This same issue has occurred multiple times in the past, but corrective actions were not documented or institutionalized.

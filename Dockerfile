Immediate Action Protocol During Index Rebuild

Dear Team,

In line with our call earlier today, the DB team will provide active monitoring throughout the index rebuild window.
If any blocking is observed, the DB team will capture the diagnostic dump and immediately terminate the affected job to maintain system stability.

Your cooperation in supporting this process is greatly appreciated.

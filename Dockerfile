Here’s a professional escalation draft you can send to the DB team:

Escalation: Index Rebuild Job Issue

Subject: Escalation – Prolonged Downtime Due to Index Rebuild Job

Dear DB Team,

We would like to escalate the recent incident where a major production issue in Bitbucket resulted in 4+ hours of downtime, with the root cause traced back to the Index Rebuild job.

Key Concerns:

No alerts/notifications were received for the prolonged Index Rebuild job.

Updates were shared only after ~20 minutes, by which time services had already started misbehaving and eventually went down.

The DB team was not aware that the Index Rebuild job needed to be terminated to restore services.

Knowledge gaps exist around identifying and releasing database locks (previously handled by the earlier DB team).

We are not receiving clear and satisfactory responses from the DB team regarding the handling of this incident.


Action Required:
We request a dedicated call with the DB team to:

Understand the gaps in monitoring and handling Index Rebuild jobs.

Review and agree on the correct procedure for identifying and unlocking database locks.

Define preventive measures to avoid prolonged downtime in the future.

Establish clear accountability and timely communication from the DB team going forward.


This incident has had a severe business impact, and we need urgent attention to prevent recurrence.

Regards,
[Your Name / Team Name]

Would you like me to also prepare a shorter version (2–3 lines escalation message for chat/email) that you can quickly send, apart from this detailed note?

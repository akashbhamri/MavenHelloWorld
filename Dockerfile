Perfect, thanks for the clarification! Based on that, hereâ€™s a full-sentence, accurate version for 6 Sept and 13 Sept:

6 Sept: On 6 September, the system experienced peak traffic of approximately 1.5 million SSH and HTTP requests during a database index rebuild. A table lock occurred for reasons that are not yet fully clear, which required manual intervention in the database and restarting the nodes one by one. This incident highlights that unexpected table locks under high load can cause a complete system outage.

13 Sept: On 13 September, the system again faced peak traffic of around 1.5 million requests during a database index rebuild. Although no table locks occurred this time, the service still experienced downtime, and nodes had to be restarted one by one to recover. This shows that even without table locks, overlapping heavy load with maintenance tasks can lead to significant disruption.

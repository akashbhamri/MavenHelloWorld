Here’s a more detailed, professional revision you can copy into your email draft.
I added the points about client approval and the agreement from the call to terminate the rebuild job if blocking occurs.

Subject: Request for Active Support During Index Rebuild

Dear Team,

As discussed on the call and agreed upon by all stakeholders, we request the DB team to provide active support during the index rebuild window.
If any blocking is observed, please:

1. Capture a diagnostic dump immediately, and


2. Proceed to terminate (kill) the rebuild job to maintain system stability, as per our agreed action plan.



This approach is aligned with the client’s approval and the consensus reached during today’s call.

Your prompt attention and cooperation in executing this process are highly appreciated.

Regards,
Akash

Would you like me to make the tone even more concise or keep it fully formal like this?

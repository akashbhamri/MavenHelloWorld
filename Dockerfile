Based on the support bundle, we are reviewing the traffic patterns. Instead of killing the jobs during rebuild, could you please check the logs and let us know the time windows when traffic is relatively low? This will help us reschedule the index rebuild from the current 7 PM slot to a more suitable time and minimize any downtime or service impact.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Justification (Why I missed the call)

I provided incident support from 11:00 PM to 1:30 AM IST.

Since the incident was prolonged, I went to bed late.

During this time, I missed a call from Srikant as I was asleep.

When I woke up at 6:00 AM, I immediately called Srikant back and logged in.

After logging in, I had to complete two activities:

1. Reveal index


2. The subsequent step (post-login activity)



The delay happened only because I had already been engaged in late-night support and slept late, which caused me to miss the call.

Action Items

The Run team needs to ensure proper communication.

They should reach out directly to active support resources whenever an issue arises, instead of relying on delayed communication.

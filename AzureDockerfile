Here’s a more polished and professional version — clear, concise, and suitable for change logs, CAB notes, or deployment descriptions:


---

Short Description:

Increase ulimit value in start_webapp.sh as per vendor recommendation


---

Description:

As per vendor guidance, we are updating the ulimit (maximum open file limit) in the start_webapp.sh script from 6192 to 65536 in the production environment.
The change has been validated in the development environment, where it worked as expected. This update aims to ensure optimal application performance and stability under higher load conditions.

Would you like me to make a slightly shorter version (for ticketing tools like Jira or ServiceNow)?

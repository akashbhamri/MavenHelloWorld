Request for Approval – Action Plan for Rebuild Index & Restart

Hi Praneeth,

Hope you’re doing well. I’d like to seek your approval on the below action plan so the team can respond effectively during such situations:

1. If the rebuild index job runs for more than 10 minutes or causes blocking, can we go ahead and request the DB team to kill the job?


2. If a similar issue occurs in the future that requires an application restart, can we proceed with restarting the application without needing additional approval each time?



This will help us handle such incidents quickly and avoid unnecessary delays. Please confirm if we can proceed with this approach.

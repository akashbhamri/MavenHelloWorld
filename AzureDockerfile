We are still trying to understand why node 10.65.4.196 is reflecting a higher value (65k) for MAX_OPEN_FILES, while ulimit -n and the startup script (start_web.sh) are identical across all four nodes.

Could you please confirm if you have reviewed the file we attached that contains the Bitbucket ulimit and ulimit -n outputs? We need your help to identify the exact source of this deviation on .196, as the other three nodes are consistent.

This will help us pinpoint the root cause of the high value being reported and check if it is linked to the spike/load issues we observed.
